# mgbrowser

A web browser written from the ground up in Rust, developed through reproducible experiments and open contribution.

**Status: pre-MVP research.** A native Linux browser can load HTML over verified HTTPS, draw text with Rust fonts, submit forms, and follow links. The local search→result→destination journey works. Google’s homepage and form load, but its search response requires JavaScript, which is not implemented; the live Google goal remains incomplete. There is no general autoresearch executor yet.

```sh
cargo run --locked --bin mgbrowser -- https://www.google.com/
```

Requires an X11/XWayland display and a DejaVu/Liberation font file, or `MGBROWSER_FONT`. See [running and testing](docs/RUNNING.md) for controls, limitations, and repeatable local interaction checks.

## Direction

Own the browser engine: HTML parsing, DOM, CSS cascade, layout, painting, navigation, and eventually JavaScript. Start with a useful static-document browser on Linux, then expand compatibility behind explicit acceptance gates. See the plan for the Rust dependency boundary and deferred decisions.

TLS uses the experimental rustls-rustcrypto provider. Fonts and PNG decoding use Rust implementations with native backends disabled. The current document view displays image placeholders/alt text; it does not yet download/render page images. See [dependency policy](docs/DEPENDENCIES.md); run `cargo test --locked` for component and UI state tests. Full CSS and JavaScript remain unimplemented.

## Website development

Open `index.html` directly, or serve the repository locally. After changing feature status or adding a daily log:

```sh
mkdir -p tmp
rustc --edition=2024 tools/site.rs -o tmp/site
tmp/site
tmp/site --check
```

Edit descriptive content in `index.html`; the marked status section is generated from `FEATURES.md` and log filenames. GitHub Actions checks it and deploys on every push to `main`. This keeps updates tied to recorded work rather than automatically inventing progress.
