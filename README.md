# mgbrowser

A web browser written from the ground up in Rust, developed through reproducible experiments and open contribution.

**Status: pre-MVP.** This repository currently contains the implementation plan, agent workflow, and project website. There is no runnable browser or autoresearch executor yet.

- Website: https://mgbrowser.org

- [Feature specification and acceptance](FEATURES.md)

## Direction

Own the browser engine: HTML parsing, DOM, CSS cascade, layout, painting, navigation, and eventually JavaScript. Start with a useful static-document browser on Linux, then expand compatibility behind explicit acceptance gates. See the plan for the Rust dependency boundary and deferred decisions.

## Website development

Open `index.html` directly, or serve the repository locally. After changing feature status or adding a daily log:

```sh
mkdir -p tmp
rustc --edition=2024 tools/site.rs -o tmp/site
tmp/site
tmp/site --check
```

Edit descriptive content in `index.html`; the marked status section is generated from `FEATURES.md` and log filenames. GitHub Actions checks it and deploys on every push to `main`. This keeps updates tied to recorded work rather than automatically inventing progress.
